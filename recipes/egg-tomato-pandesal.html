    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional pandesal with sauteed egg and tomatoes as palaman (what goes in a bread, such as a spread), perfectly eaten for breakfast with coffee.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>pandesal</li>
        <li>eggs, 4 pieces</li>
        <li>tomatoes, 3 pieces</li>
        <li>garlic, 2 cloves</li>
        <li>onion, 1 bulb</li>
        <li>butter, 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>MSG, to taste</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>rosemary or thyme, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the onion into thin slices. Slice the tomatoes into small medium-sized cubes. Mince the garlic finely.</li>
        <li>Saute the onion, tomato, and garlic in a pan with butter. Add a little water to help soften the tomatoes. Season with herbs and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs, adding in salt to your preference.</li>
        <li>Crush the tomatoes with your spatula and add in the beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>Scramble the egg and tomato mixture until the egg develops some structure. Doneness and how stiff the eggs would be depend on your preference.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer to a plate. Open the pandesal on its side and fill it with eggs. Enjoy!</li>
